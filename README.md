The Markdown package converts [markdown][] markup to TeX commands. The
functionality is provided both as a Lua module, and as plain TeX, LaTeX, and
ConTeXt macro packages that can be used to directly typeset TeX documents
containing markdown markup. Unlike other convertors, the Markdown package
does not require any external programs, and makes it easy to redefine how each
and every markdown element is rendered. Creative abuse of the markdown syntax
is encouraged. 😉

Further information
-------------------

For further information, consult one of the following:

1. The [user manual][manual], which can be produced by interpreting the
   `markdown.ins` file using a Unicode-aware TeX engine, such as XeTeX
   (`xetex markdown.ins`) or LuaTeX (`luatex markdown.ins`). The manual will
   reside in the file `markdown.md` and the CSS stylesheet `markdown.css`.
2. The [technical documentation][techdoc], which can be typeset by running the
   [LaTeXMK][] tool on the `markdown.dtx` file
   (`latexmk markdown.dtx`) after [installing the Markdown package][install].
   [LaTeXMK][] should be included in your TeX distribution. The typeset
   documentation will reside in the file `markdown.pdf`.

Contributing
------------

Apart from the example markdown documents, tests, and continuous integration,
which are placed in the `examples/`, `tests/`, and `.circleci/` directories,
the complete source code and documentation of the package are placed in the
`markdown.dtx` document following the [literate programming][] paradigm.
Some useful commands, such as building the release archives and typesetting
the documentation, are placed in the `Makefile` file for ease of maintenance.

When the file `markdown.ins` is interpreted using a Unicode-aware TeX engine,
such as XeTeX (`xetex markdown.ins`) or LuaTeX (`luatex markdown.ins`), several
files are produced from the `markdown.dtx` document. In `markdown.dtx`, the
boundaries between the produced files are marked up using an XML-like syntax
provided by the [DocStrip][] plain TeX package.

Running the [LaTeXMK][] tool on the `markdown.dtx` file
(`latexmk markdown.dtx`) after the Markdown package has been
[installed][install] typesets the documentation. In `markdown.dtx`, the
documentation is placed inside TeX comments and marked up using the
[ltxdockit][] LaTeX document class. Support for typesetting the documentation
is provided by the [doc][] LaTeX package.
